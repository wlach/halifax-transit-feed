=== Introduction === 

This distribution contains everything required to build a basic google transit 
feed for Halifax Metro Transit, Nova Scotia, Canada. Note that it is woefully 
incomplete at the moment. 

Requirements: GNU Make, Perl, Python 2.5.

=== Usage ===

First, grab a copy of google transit feed tools:

cd $HOME/src
wget http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/files/transitfeed-1.2.1.tar.gz
tar zxvf transitfeed-1.2.1.tar.gz

Set PYTHONPATH to the python directory in the above checkout:

export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/src/transitfeed-1.2.1/python

Then just type "make" to build the feed. The output at the end is "feed.zip".
For fun, you can view this feed using the snazzy transit feed view application:

$HOME/src/transitfeed-1.2.1/python/schedule_viewer.py --feed=hfxfeed.zip

=== Copyright ===

With the exception of createfeed.py, which is licensed under the Apache Public
License, please consider all software tools in distribution to be in the public

I believe the Metro Transit route data is considered factual information
which can not be copyrighted. Note, however, that Metro Transit and/or
the city of Halifax may have claim over its own name and other trademarks.
